The Resume Builder is a modern web application designed to help users create professional resumes effortlessly using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, and Supabase. It addresses common challenges such as limited technical skills, formatting difficulties, and time constraints by providing an intuitive interface where users input their data and instantly receive a polished resume in various professional templates. Real-time previews and data validation ensure accuracy and user satisfaction during the creation process.
